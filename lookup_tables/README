Lookup tables of predicted summary statistics generated with moments++
In all tables, the demographic model is represented by the "Ns" and "Ts" columns.
These are semicolon-separated vectors indicating, respectively, population sizes (from present to past) and the time when size changes happened (in units of generations ago).

Equilibrium: steady-state values up to strong selection (s=-0.005) and high recombination (r=0.5)

Two Epochs: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck or expansion happening 20,000 generations ago (starting at an equilibrium population of size 10,000).

Three Epochs: temporal dynamics following a population size history with Na=10,000, N1=2,000 and N2=20,000 with size changes happening at t1=4,000 generations ago and t2=2,000 generations ago

Four Epochs: temporal dynamics following a population size history with Na=30,000, N1=20,000, N2=40,000 and N3=15,000 with size changes happening at t1=100,000, t2=24,000 and t3=4,000. This demographic model loosely follows the inference of Cousins et al 2024 who used a PSMC model that accounts for BGS.

Ne_bar: steady-state values for different N. This reflects the effective population size (Ne_bar) as recorded in purely neutral genetic diversity (pi0) at different time-points following a 10X bottleneck (from 10,000 to 1,000). Although statistics are obtained in steady-state using the corresponding value in the Ns column, the Generation of this table column shows the corresponding time-points that are equivalent in the bottleneck scenario.

0.001_0.005: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck happening 20,000 generations ago (starting at an equilibrium population of size 10,000). This table includes only selection coefficients from -0.001 to -0.005.

two-locus: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck or expansion happening 120,000 generations ago (starting at an equilibrium population of size 10,000). Here the grid of parameters is quite sparse (three recombination and three selection values) but the temporal sampling is dense and goes farther in time.

two-locus_extended: similar to two-locus, but sampling every 20,000 generations for a total of 2,000,000 generations since the expansion (enough to reach equilibrium when the new populazion size is 100,000)
