Lookup tables of predicted summary statistics generated with moments++
In all tables, the demographic model is represented by the "Ns" and "Ts" columns.
These are semicolon-separated vectors indicating, respectively, population sizes (from present to past) and the time when size changes happened (in units of generations ago).

Equilibrium: steady-state values up to strong selection (s=-0.005) and high recombination (r=0.5)

Two Epochs: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck or expansion happening 20,000 generations ago (starting at an equilibrium population of size 10,000).

Three Epochs: temporal dynamics following a population size history with Na=10,000, N1=2,000 and N2=20,000 with size changes happening at t1=4,000 generations ago and t2=2,000 generations ago

Ne_bar: steady-state values for different N. This reflects the effective population size (Ne_bar) as recorded in purely neutral genetic diversity (pi0) at different time-points following a 10X bottleneck (from 10,000 to 1,000). Although statistics are obtained in steady-state using the corresponding value in the Ns column, the Generation of this table column shows the corresponding time-points that are equivalent in the bottleneck scenario.

0.001_0.005: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck happening 20,000 generations ago (starting at an equilibrium population of size 10,000). This table includes only selection coefficients from -0.001 to -0.005.
