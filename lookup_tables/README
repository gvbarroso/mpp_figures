Lookup tables of predicted summary statistics generated with moments++

Equilibrium: steady-state values up to strong selection (s=-0.005) and high recombination (r=0.5)
Two Epochs: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck or expansion (indicated by the N1 column)
Three Epochs: temporal dynamics following a population size history with Na=10,000, N1=2,000 and N2=20,000
