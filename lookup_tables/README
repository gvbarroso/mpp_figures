Lookup tables of predicted summary statistics generated with moments++

Equilibrium: steady-state values up to strong selection (s=-0.005) and high recombination (r=0.5)
Two Epochs: temporal dynamics after a 10-fold bottleneck or expansion (indicated by the N1 column)
Three Epochs: temporal dynamics following a population size history with Na=10,000, N1=2,000 and N2=20,000 with size changes happening at t1=4,000 generations ago and t2=2,000 generations ago
Ne_bar: steady-state values varying Na. This reflects the effective population size (Ne_bar) as recorded in purely neutral genetic diversity (pi0) at different time-points following a 10X bottleneck (from 10,000 to 1,000). Although statistics are obtained in steady-state using the corresponding Na, the Generation column shows the corresponding time-points that are equivalent in the bottleneck scenario
